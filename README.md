# YouTube_video_title_downloader
This is a windows  python+ selenium +chromedriver project.
The purpose of the project is to download YouTbe encrypted network traffic of Dynamice Adaptive Streaming over HTTP (DASH) videos.
With the help of this downloader we can create a training and testing set in order to classify YouTube video titles.
